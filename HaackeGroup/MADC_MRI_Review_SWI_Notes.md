## MADC MRI review with SWI images

### MADC's 1st MRI review /w SWI - 4/11/2018
- attendees: Judy, Navid, Sean
- MADC's first 20 scans were reviewed: UDS 1337 - UDS 1380
- procedures:
    1. T1 coronal - for hippocampal deficit
    2. T1 saggital - for FTD patterns
    3. T2 FLAIR - for white matter hyperintensities
    4. SWI - for microhemorrages
    5. SWI MIP - further validation of microhemorrages
- Haacke's group computer generated report for group (first 20 subjects) were helpful and provided further quantified information to aide decisions made by neurologists
- will need to coordinate with DataCore on subjects to pull as well as the order based off of MRI scan sequence (which is contingent with Haacke's group processing)
